## Installation

To get started with the React Native Quiz Game, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository

> git clone https://github.com/OmarShalaby24/GuessTheFlag.git
> cd GuessTheFlag

#### 2. Install dependencies

> npm install
> \# or if you're using yarn
> yarn install

#### 3. Run the application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

##### For Android

> \# using npm
> npm run android
> \# OR using Yarn
> yarn android

##### For iOS

> \# using npm
> npm run ios
> \# OR using Yarn
> yarn ios

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Usage

Once you have the application running on your emulator or physical device, navigate through the app to select a quiz category and start answering questions. Track your progress and try to beat your high score!
