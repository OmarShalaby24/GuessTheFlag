Add fonts:
  - add fonts to the project (I added them in ./src/assets/fonts)
  - create react-native.config.js file in root folder
  - add these lines in the created file
      module.export = {
        assets: ['./src/assets/fonts/'],
      }
  - run "->npx react-native-assets"
  - now you can add fonts in styles
